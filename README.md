# Financial Data Web Component

## Introduction

`rise-data-financial` is a Polymer 3 Web Component that works together with the [Rise Vision Financial Selector](https://selector.risevision.com/), a web app for managing financial content. It retrieves the financial list and its corresponding instruments from [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). Data is refreshed in realtime, so any changes that are made to a particular financial list in the Financial Selector are immediately propagated to the `rise-data-financial` component.
